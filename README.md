# Problem Set Template Repository for Big Data and Machine Learning for Applied Economics

This is the template repository for the problem sets.

The repo should contain at least four folders:

- `document`: contains your final document in `pdf` format. Ideally, the document should pull figures and tables directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created for the Thesis Seminar. 
- `scripts`: contains all your scripts
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used. If files are "too big" for GitHub, include a document describing where people can access the data.
- `views`: contains all figures and tables



## Some general reminders: 

- It is essential how you write up the document. Be sure to be organized and consistent in explaining your equations and findings. Make sure that there are no compilation errors.
- Write understandable code, separating and commenting on each section. Coding, like in writing, style is critical for readability. If the code is well written, it should be self-contained. There is no need to write everything you did. I encourage you to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
